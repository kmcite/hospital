### Navigator

The navigator is based on the **States Rebuilder** package’s `navigation_builder`.
It supports both imperative and declarative APIs.

For simplicity, we focus on the easy-to-use **imperative APIs**:

* **`.navigatorKey`** – Connects the navigator to `MaterialApp`.
* **`.to(Widget page)`** – Pushes a new page onto the navigation stack.
* **`.back()`** – Pops the current page from the navigation stack.
