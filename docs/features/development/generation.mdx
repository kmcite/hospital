kmcite: SUMMARIZE THE WHOLE LIB FOLDER WHAT ENTITIES ARE THERE IN THE CODE AND BRIEFLI IN ONE LINE WHAT T DOES.

GitHub Copilot: Here's a summary of the main entities and their purposes in the hospital management system:

### Core Entities

- **Patient**: Represents hospital patients with their medical records and status
- **Doctor**: Medical staff member who treats patients
- **Staff**: General personnel including nurses and receptionists
- **Facility**: Hospital facilities and resources
- **Symptom**: Medical conditions that patients present with
- **Score**: Scoring/rating system (likely for hospital performance)

### Management Systems

- **Clinic**: Main business logic for hospital operations
- **Reception**: Handles patient intake and registration
- **HiringManager**: Manages staff recruitment and assignment
- **PatientFlow**: Controls patient movement through hospital
- **Balance**: Financial management including investments and receipts

### Key Features

- **AutoTreatment**: Automated patient care system
- **StaffGeneration**: Creates staff entries
- **PatientGeneration**: Creates new patient entries
- **DutyAssignment**: Manages staff schedules
- **ChitSystem**: Handles medical documentation
- **Ambulance**: Emergency transport service management

The codebase appears to be a comprehensive hospital management system written in Dart, likely a Flutter application, handling everything from patient intake to staff management, medical treatments, and financial operations.
