Got it üëç You want me to generate **documentation / pointers** for this code, but **without showing the actual code**. Here‚Äôs a structured doc you could include in your project:

# üìò Hospital App ‚Äì Documentation

### üîπ Global State & Subscriptions

- **`dark`** ‚Üí a computed value bound to app settings for theme mode (light/dark).
- **`subscriptions`** ‚Üí a global list that stores all active stream subscriptions.
- **`subscribe()`** ‚Üí helper to register new subscriptions into the list.
- **`cancelSubscriptions()`** ‚Üí cancels and clears all active subscriptions (called during dispose).

---

### üîπ HospitalApp Class (Main UI Entry)

- Extends a custom `UI` base class.
- **`initState()`** ‚Üí runs app startup logic:

  - Starts patient generation.
  - (Other simulation loops like staff generation, duty assignment, treatment, salaries, etc. can be toggled on/off here).

- **`dispose()`** ‚Üí cleans up subscriptions to prevent memory leaks.

---

### üîπ MaterialApp Configuration

- Uses **`navigatorKey`** from a custom navigator utility for global navigation.
- **`debugShowCheckedModeBanner`** is disabled for production.
- **Themes**:

  - Dark and light themes are provided via `HuxTheme`.
  - Customizations applied to `ProgressIndicatorTheme` and `SliderTheme`.

- **ThemeMode** ‚Üí automatically switches between dark and light mode based on user settings (`dark`).
- **Home Page** ‚Üí The main landing page is the **Dashboard** widget.

---

‚úÖ **Key Takeaways**

- Centralized subscription handling ‚Üí no memory leaks.
- Simulation features (patients, staff, treatments, salaries) are modular and can be started/stopped in `initState()`.
- Adaptive theming with a global `dark` computed state.
- Entry point `HospitalApp` sets up navigation, theming, and home screen.

## üöÄ Project Structure

### Domain Layer

- **Models** (`/lib/apis/*`):

  - `Receipt`
  - this entity is use for maintaining balance/money transactions
  - `Staff`
    - `Doctor`
    - `Nurse`
    - `Receptionist`
  - Example:
    - `Patient` includes properties like `name`, `admissionTime`, `remainingTime`, `satisfaction`, and relationships with `Doctor` and `Symptom`.
    - `Facility` tracks hospital-level attributes like `waitingAreaBeds`, `admissionBeds`, `nursesCapacity`, and `doctorsCapacity`.

- **Repositories** (`/lib/apis/*`):
- **APIs/Repositories** (`/lib/domain/api/`):
  - `DoctorsRepository` manages doctor-related operations like assigning doctors to patients.
  - `NursesRepository` manages doctor-related operations like assigning doctors to patients.
  - `ReceptionistsRepository` manages doctor-related operations like assigning doctors to patients.
  - `SettingsRepository` handles global settings like funds and dark mode preferences.
  - `BalanceRepository` handles transactions

---

### UI Layer

- **Pages** (`/lib/ui/`):

  - Organized by feature, such as `admitted`, `waiting`, and `hospital`.
  - Example:
    - `AdmittedPatientsPage` displays a list of admitted patients and allows actions like discharge or referral.
    - `WaitingPatientsPage` shows patients waiting for admission and provides options to admit, refer, or discharge them.

- **Components**:
  - Reusable UI components like `FundsBadge`, `CharityBadge`, and `HospitalBanner`.

---

### Utils

- **Utility Functions** (`/lib/utils/`):
  - Contains helper functions and shared logic used across the application.

---

## Key Features

### Patient Management

- Patients are generated with attributes like urgency, satisfaction, and payment ability.
- Players can admit, refer, or discharge patients based on hospital resources.

### Resource Management

- Resources like beds, doctors, and equipment are tracked and updated in real-time.
- The `Facility` model defines the hospital's capacity for resources.

### Doctor Management

- Doctors can be hired, assigned to patients, or put on leave.
- The `DoctorsLounge` UI provides an overview of doctors' statuses.

### State Management

- Uses `states_rebuilder` for reactive state updates.
- Repositories provide a centralized way to access and manipulate state.

### Data Persistence

- ObjectBox is used for storing game data, including patients, doctors, and resources.
- Relationships between entities (e.g., `Patient` and `Doctor`) are managed using ObjectBox's `ToOne` and `ToMany` relations.

---

## Gameplay Flow

1. **Waiting Room**:

   - Patients arrive and wait for admission.
   - Players can admit patients if resources are available.

2. **Admitted Patients**:

   - Admitted patients are treated by doctors.
   - Players can discharge or refer patients based on their status.

3. **Resource Management**:

   - Players must manage resources like beds and staff to ensure smooth operations.

4. **Progression**:
   - Players earn points and funds based on successful treatments.
   - Funds can be used to hire doctors or upgrade the facility.

---

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Style

- **Variables, Functions, Methods**: camelCase
- **Classes, Interfaces, Enums**: PascalCase
- **Files**: snake_case (e.g., `admitted_patients_page.dart`)

### Architecture Patterns

- Repository pattern for data access.
- Separation of UI and business logic using mixins and blocs.

### State Management

- Reactive programming with `states_rebuilder`.
- State updates are triggered through repository methods.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add progression mechanics like hospital upgrades and new features.
- Enhance UI/UX with animations and sound effects.
- Implement offline save and resume functionality.
