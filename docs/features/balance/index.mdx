# Salary Awarding System

## Overview

The **Salary Awarding Loop** (`startGivingOutSalaries`) is responsible for paying all hired staff at regular intervals.
It ensures staff members receive their salary automatically, simulating real-world payroll.
---

## Core Logic

- Runs indefinitely with a **30-second delay** (`Future.delayed`).
- On each cycle:

  - Logs `"[AwardingSalariesToHiredStaffs]"` to track payroll events.
  - Iterates through all hired staff:

    - Nurses (`nurses.values`)
    - Doctors (`doctors.values`)
    - Receptionists (`receptionists.values`)

  - Issues a **salary payment** to each staff member.

---

## Salary Processing

- A `Receipt` object is created for each staff salary.
- Fields set in the receipt:

  - `balance` → Equal to the staff’s salary.
  - `details` → `"Salary"`.

- Sent to `balanceRepository.useBalance` for accounting.

---

## Important Variables

- `nurses`, `doctors`, `receptionists` → Maps of active staff members.
- `staff.salary` → Salary amount for each staff member.
- `balanceRepository` → Manages financial transactions (income & expenses).
- `Receipt` → Data structure for recording salary disbursement.

---

## Simulation Purpose

This system simulates:

- **Automated payroll** for all hired staff.
- **Financial deductions** from hospital balance.
- **Bookkeeping consistency** via receipts.
