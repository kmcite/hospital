# 🏥 Hospital Simulation Game

## 🎮 Overview

The **Hospital Simulation Game** is a Flutter-based project where players manage a virtual hospital.  
Your goal is to **admit patients, hire staff, allocate resources, and keep operations running smoothly**.

The project is built with:

- ⚡ Reactive state management
- 💾 ObjectBox for local data persistence
- 🧩 Modular, scalable architecture

## 🏗 Game Components

The hospital is divided into major departments. Each plays a key role in gameplay and development.

### 🚨 Emergency

- First point of contact for critical patients.
- Players must allocate staff quickly to save lives.

### 🏢 Administration

- Manages hospital finances, resources, and upgrades.
- Ensures the balance between costs and quality of care.

### 👩‍⚕️ Outpatient Department (OPD)

- Handles non-emergency consultations.
- Involves scheduling doctors, assigning nurses, and managing patient flow.

### 🧑‍💼 Human Resources (HR)

- Hire, assign, and manage staff (doctors, nurses, receptionists).
- Balance workloads to avoid burnout and inefficiency.

## 🚀 For Developers
