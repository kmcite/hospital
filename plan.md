Below is a month-by-month plan from April through December to help guide your hospital game’s development. This plan focuses on gradually building robust core features, deepening gameplay, and polishing the final product for a smooth offline experience.

April: Solidify the Core Mechanics
Finalize MVP Features:

Review and refine existing core features (patient arrival, basic assessment, and management).

Ensure CRUD operations on the Floor DB (insert, update, query patients and resources) are solid.

Refactoring & Stability:

Refactor code to improve maintainability.

Write unit tests for basic functionalities (e.g., patient status updates).

Documentation:

Create clear documentation or a simple UML diagram outlining key flows (patient lifecycle, resource management).

May: Introduce Dynamic Patient Workflow
Patient Generation:

Implement randomized patient generation with diverse conditions and severity levels.

Add logic to generate new patients at timed intervals.

Timed Events:

Start incorporating timers for critical cases (e.g., patient treatment windows).

Experiment with simple game loops that process patient events asynchronously.

Feedback Loops:

Provide immediate user feedback for decisions (confirmation dialogs, brief animations).

June: Develop Hospital Resource Management
Resource Tracking:

Set up and integrate a Resource table in Floor DB (beds, doctors, equipment).

Create methods to update resources as patients are admitted, treated, or discharged.

Resource UI:

Build a dashboard or status bar displaying current hospital resources.

Ensure resource changes are reflected in real time.

Linking Mechanics:

Connect patient management to resource depletion/replenishment (e.g., admitting a patient decreases bed count).

July: Introduce Progression and Upgrades
Points & Scoring:

Design a basic points system: award points based on treatment success and speed.

Upgrades & Incentives:

Implement upgrade mechanics using points (e.g., additional beds, faster diagnostics).

Create UI components for viewing and purchasing upgrades.

Data Persistence:

Use Floor DB to store game progress, including points and upgrades.

August: Enhance UI/UX and Visual Polish
User Interface Refinement:

Revisit screen layouts (patient arrival, assessment, resource dashboard).

Apply a consistent visual theme that’s both functional and engaging.

Animations & Visual Feedback:

Integrate simple animations (e.g., patient transitions, resource updates).

Enhance feedback during user actions (sound effects, progress bars) to enrich the gaming experience.

Usability Testing:

Conduct informal testing sessions to gauge user understanding and flow.

September: Offline Functionality & State Management
Save & Resume:

Implement a “Save Game” feature using Floor DB so users can pick up where they left off.

Test edge cases (e.g., abrupt app closure, database corruption prevention).

State Management:

Integrate a state management solution (e.g., Provider or Riverpod) to handle patient flows, resource updates, and game state efficiently.

Optimize Database Queries:

Audit and optimize critical queries to ensure smooth performance as the game state grows.

October: Beta Testing and Quality Assurance
Bug Fixes & Refinements:

Launch a closed beta with trusted peers or colleagues.

Collect feedback on gameplay, UI glitches, and overall experience.

Prioritize and fix bugs, refine timers, and adjust game difficulty based on feedback.

Performance Monitoring:

Use debugging tools to monitor app performance and memory usage on various devices.

Iterative Improvements:

Make iterative refinements—small tweaks can significantly enhance gameplay and user satisfaction.

November: Final Optimization and Polish
Performance Enhancements:

Further optimize the app: reduce load times, refine animations, and streamline database calls.

Visual & Audio Polish:

Finalize sound effects, background music, and fine-tune animations and transitions.

Documentation for Deployment:

Prepare detailed in-app help or tutorial screens explaining gameplay mechanics.

Update all development documentation and prepare notes for future maintenance.

Pre-Release Testing:

Complete a final testing round simulating long play sessions, ensuring offline stability.

December: Final Touches and Portfolio Preparation
Bug Sweep & Final Debugging:

Conduct a thorough final review to squash any remaining bugs.

Create a Portfolio-Ready Package:

Prepare marketing materials including a demo video, screenshots, and a detailed project description that highlights your unique blend of medical and coding expertise.

Documentation & Release Plan:

Finalize all user documentation, in-app guides, and release notes.

Decide on your release approach—whether it’s a public launch or a portfolio showcase.

Reflection & Future Planning:

Document lessons learned during the project.

Plan potential future updates or additional features based on your journey.
